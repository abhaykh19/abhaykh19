"Kimberly-Clark delivered 7 percent organic growth in 2022 and an average of 4 percent organic growth on a three-year basis," said Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu. "Our growth strategy is working with the support of excellent execution by our teams around the world and investments in our strong brands and commercial capabilities."

We're proud of our heritage of category defining innovation rooted in providing care for our consumers. As we look to the future, we will continue to drive our strategy to deliver profitable growth for long-term value creation as we fulfill our purpose of Better Care for a Better World."
Fourth Quarter 2022 Operating Results
Sales of $5.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 were even with the year-ago period. Organic sales increased 5 percent as net selling prices rose approximately 10 percent and product mix increased sales 1 percent while volumes declined 7 percent. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales 5 percent. In North America, organic sales increased 1 percent in consumer products and increased 18 percent in K-C
Professional. Outside North America, organic sales rose 3 percent in developing and emerging (D&E) markets and 11 percent in developed markets.

Fourth quarter operating profit was $712 million in 2022 and $521 million in 2021. Excluding the charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, 2021 adjusted operating profit was $611 million.
Results benefited from higher net selling prices, favorable product mix and $115 million of cost savings from the company's FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program. The comparison was impacted by $245 million of higher input costs as well as lower volumes and the associated fixed cost under absorption. Unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher marketing, research and general expense also reduced operating profit in the quarter.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 22.5 percent in 2022 and 20.9 percent in 2021. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6 percent in 2022 and 21.9 percent in 2021.

Forward Looking Statements
Certain matters contained in this news release concerning the outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, raw material, energy and other input costs, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including in Argentina and Turkey, net income from equity companies, sources and uses of cash, the effective tax rate, the anticipated cost savings from the company's FORCE program, growth initiatives, product innovations, contingencies and anticipated transactions of the company constitute forward-looking statements and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company. In addition, many factors outside our control, including the war in Ukraine (including the related responses of consumers, customers and suppliers as well as sanctions issued by the U.S., the European Union, Russia or other countries), pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and the related responses of governments, consumers, customers, suppliers and employees), epidemics, the prices and availability of our raw materials, supply chain disruptions, failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from our acquisition and disposition activity (including our pending agreement to sell our Neve tissue brand and associated assets in Brazil), changes in customer preferences, severe weather conditions, government trade or similar regulatory actions, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, our ability to maintain key customer relationships, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.
There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them. For a description of certain factors that could cause the company's future results to differ from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements, see Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

Adjusted earnings and earnings per share Adjusted gross and operating profit Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

Pension settlements. In 2022, the company recognized pension settlement charges related to lump-sum distributions from pension plan assets exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs resulting in a recognition of deferred actuarial losses.
Acquisition of controlling interest in Thinx. In the first quarter of 2022, the company completed the acquisition of a majority and controlling share of Thinx. As a result of this transaction, a net benefit was recognized primarily due to the nonrecurring, non-cash gain recognized related to the remeasurement of the carrying value of previously held equity investment to fair value partially offset by transaction and integration costs.
2018 Global Restructuring Program. In 2018, the company initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. Restructuring charges were incurred in 2018 through 2021. The restructuring actions were completed by the end of 2021.
 
The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.
Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital determined by excluding certain of the adjustments that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.
This news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.
